Fire behavior application

## Build for web

```
flutter build web --base-href /MyBaseFolder/
```

## Code Conventions

- Dart naming convention rules are often broken in order to conform with the CFFDRS R library. The R code has been
manually translated, and in order to debug and stay up to date with changes, it's just easier if the code looks
similar.

## Todo

- Localization - implement en-CA and fr-CA.
- Coordinates - provide user feedback on location button. (e.g. fetching and failed state).
- Add FMC option in advanced.
- Advanced: Change PDF and PC to sliders.
- Advanced: Problem: pre-set can conflict with entered values. The moment. anything is changed, the pre-set should become un-set OR You need a "load preset" button - maybe that's better?
- Advanced: Result columns - there are some "two line" columns. Would be nice if the result columns could size better.
- FFMC scale at the bottom.
  - Possible, but nothing out of the box - so leaving it alone for now.
- Finalise disclaimer.
- Finalise popup.
- Diurnal FFMC screen.
  - Add a screen where you can input yesterday's FFMC the RH and the Wind, to get the daily FFMC.
  - Add a screen where you you can see the impact of the diurnal FFMC (maybe sliding time?)
  - Work towards a screen where you can see the impact of changing FFMC on fire.
