Fire behavior application

## Build for web

```
flutter build web --base-href /MyBaseFolder/
```

## Build for Android

Up the version in pubspec.yaml, then run
```
flutter pub get
```
NOTE: also had to up flutterVersionCode  in android\app\build.gradle

```
flutter build appbundle
```

internal testing -> create new release -> upload
relesases overview -> review it


## Build for iOS - on M1 silicon

If you use the default ruby+gem setup that comes out of the box, you'll get errors about
ffi not being x86_64 - you COULD fix that by running:

```
# don't do this
sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi
```

Who wants to run rosetta? That's nuts. Rather get the latest version of ruby and go from there.
(It's no use trying to run gem update --system with the system ruby, it's just going to break things for you)
This also solves having to run sudo with gem, everything neatly goes into .rbenv

```
rbenv install 3.1.0
rbenv global 3.1.0
gem update --system
gem install cocoapods
```

## App store issues

You may receive an email warning: "ITMS-90078: Missing Push Notification Entitlement" from the app store. FBP Go doesn't use push notifications,
it seems to be a side efffect of some flutter stuff. See: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9984 ; this issue is unresolved at this point in time.

## iOS development notes

```
open -a Simulator
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

## Deploy to app store

Product -> Archive (make sure you've seleted the correct target)

## Code Conventions

- Dart naming convention rules are often broken in order to conform with the CFFDRS R library. The R code has been
manually translated, and in order to debug and stay up to date with changes, it's just easier if the code looks
similar.

## Todo

- Coordinates - permission handler - implemeted and tested for Android, need to test on iOS
- Add FWI.
- Consider: reducing the lower range of FFMC to 60.
- Grey out the curing slider for fuel types it doesn't apply to.
- Add screenshots for iOS.
- Localization - implement en-CA and fr-CA.
- Coordinates - provide user feedback on location button. (e.g. fetching and failed state).
- Add FMC option in advanced.
- Advanced: Problem: pre-set can conflict with entered values. The moment. anything is changed, the pre-set should become un-set OR You need a "load preset" button - maybe that's better?
- Advanced: Result columns - there are some "two line" columns. Would be nice if the result columns could size better.
- FFMC scale at the bottom.
  - Possible, but nothing out of the box - so leaving it alone for now.
- Finalise disclaimer.
- Finalise popup.
- Diurnal FFMC screen.
  - Add a screen where you can input yesterday's FFMC the RH and the Wind, to get the daily FFMC - see: ffmcCalc.
  - Add a screen where you you can see the impact of the diurnal FFMC (maybe sliding time?) - see: hffmc.
  - Work towards a screen where you can see the impact of changing FFMC on fire.
- Do lots of re-factoring (code was written as p.o.c. in a big rush).
- Persist last settings? (Except for lat/long - since that's a log of the persons location and we don't want to persist anything personal)
